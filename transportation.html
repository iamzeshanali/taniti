            <p><strong>Rental Cars:</strong> Several rental car agencies operate on Taniti, offering a range of vehicles from compact cars to SUVs.

Most rental agencies are located near the airport and in Taniti City, and many hotels can arrange rentals for their guests.</p>

            <p>Driving on Taniti is relatively easy, as most roads are well-maintained and traffic is generally light outside of Taniti City. The speed limit in Taniti City is 25 mph, and 40 mph outside the city. Visitors should note that driving is on the right side of the road, and an international driver's license is recommended.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Taxis are readily available throughout Taniti, particularly in Taniti City and at the airport, hotels, and major tourist areas.

            <p><strong>Bicycle Rentals:</strong> For the more adventurous and environmentally conscious traveler, bicycle rentals are available at several locations throughout the island. Biking is a popular way to explore Taniti, especially in the flatter southern and eastern regions. Many visitors enjoy the slower pace and the ability to stop and explore interesting spots along the way.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Taniti City is compact and very walkable, with most hotels, restaurants, shops, and attractions within easy walking distance of each other. Many visitors find that they can explore the city on foot and only need transportation for trips to beaches, the volcano, or other outlying areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Tour Buses:</strong> Several tour companies offer guided bus tours that take visitors to major attractions around the island. These tours are a great option for first-time visitors who want to see the highlights and learn about Taniti's history and culture from knowledgeable guides. Tour buses typically visit the volcano viewing area, beaches, rainforest trails, and cultural sites.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Transportation Tips</h3>
            <p>When planning your transportation on Taniti, consider that the island is relatively small, and most destinations are within a 30-45 minute drive from Taniti City. Many visitors find that a combination of walking, public buses, and occasional taxis or rental cars works well for their needs.</p>

            <p>If you're staying at a resort, many offer complimentary shuttle services to Taniti City and popular beaches. Check with your accommodation about available transportation services when making your reservation.</p>

            <p>For those planning to explore extensively, a rental car provides the most flexibility. However, if you're primarily staying in Taniti City and visiting nearby beaches, the public bus system and taxis may be all you need.</p>
