            <p>Planning your trip to Taniti is easy! Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway, a family vacation, or an adventure-filled escape, we're here to help you create the perfect itinerary.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">How to Book</h3>
            <p>You can make reservations for accommodations, activities, and transportation through several convenient methods:</p>

            <p><strong>Online Booking:</strong> Many hotels, resorts, and tour operators on Taniti offer online booking through their websites or through popular travel booking platforms. This allows you to compare options, read reviews, and secure your reservations in advance.</p>

            <p><strong>Travel Agents:</strong> Working with a travel agent who specializes in Pacific island destinations can be helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Travel agents can help coordinate flights, accommodations, and activities, and often have access to special packages and deals.</p>

            <p><strong>Direct Contact:</strong> You can also contact accommodations and tour operators directly via phone or email. Many smaller establishments prefer direct bookings and may offer personalized service and local recommendations.</p>

            <p><strong>Tourism Board Assistance:</strong> The Taniti Tourism Board is available to help answer questions and provide recommendations. While we don't process bookings directly, we can guide you to reputable businesses and help you plan your itinerary.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">What to Book in Advance</h3>
            <p>While Taniti maintains a relaxed atmosphere, we recommend booking certain elements of your trip in advance, especially during peak season (June through August and December through February).</p>

            <p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> It's wise to book your hotel or resort well in advance, particularly if you're traveling during peak season or have specific preferences. Popular resorts and beachfront properties can fill up months ahead of time.</p>

            <p><strong>Flights:</strong> Air travel to Taniti should be booked as early as possible, as flights can be limited and prices can increase closer to travel dates. Keep in mind that flight schedules may change, so it's important to confirm your flights closer to your departure date.</p>

            <p><strong>Special Activities:</strong> Popular tours, such as volcano hikes, diving excursions, and cultural experiences, often require advance booking, especially for groups. Many tour operators have limited capacity, so booking ahead ensures you won't miss out on must-do activities.</p>

            <p><strong>Restaurant Reservations:</strong> While not always necessary, fine dining restaurants and popular eateries may require reservations, particularly on weekends or during peak season. It's always a good idea to call ahead for upscale dining experiences.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Flexible Options</h3>
            <p>Many aspects of your Taniti vacation can be arranged upon arrival or with short notice:</p>

            <p><strong>Daily Activities:</strong> Many activities, such as beach visits, casual dining, shopping, and exploring Taniti City, require no advance booking. You can plan these activities day by day based on weather and your interests.</p>

            <p><strong>Transportation:</strong> Rental cars, taxis, and public buses are generally available without advance booking, though you may want to reserve a rental car during peak season if you have specific preferences.</p>

            <p><strong>Last-Minute Tours:</strong> Some tour operators offer same-day or next-day bookings, though availability may be limited. If you're flexible with your schedule, you can often find great last-minute options.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Packages & Deals</h3>
            <p>Many hotels and resorts offer vacation packages that combine accommodations with activities, meals, or transportation. These packages can provide excellent value and simplify your planning. Look for packages that include:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Accommodations and airport transfers</li>
                <li>All-inclusive meal plans</li>
                <li>Activity packages (snorkeling, tours, etc.)</li>
                <li>Romance packages for couples</li>
                <li>Family packages with activities for children</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Cancellation Policies</h3>
            <p>Most accommodations and tour operators on Taniti have cancellation policies that allow for refunds or changes if you cancel within a certain timeframe (typically 24-48 hours in advance). Be sure to review cancellation policies when making your reservations, especially for non-refundable bookings or during peak season.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Travel Insurance</h3>
            <p>We recommend purchasing travel insurance for your trip to Taniti. Travel insurance can protect you in case of trip cancellations, medical emergencies, lost luggage, or other unexpected situations. Many travel insurance policies also provide coverage for activities like diving and hiking.</p>
