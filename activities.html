            <p>Yoga classes are available at various locations throughout the island, often held in beautiful outdoor settings overlooking the ocean or in the peaceful rainforest. Several spas offer traditional island treatments using local ingredients like coconut oil and tropical flowers.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #1a5f5f;">Nightlife & Entertainment</h3>
